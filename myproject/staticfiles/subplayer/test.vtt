1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
I underscored genuinely data dependent

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.940
and if he is in fact really data

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.120
dependent the data don't lie and that

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.620
it's going to continue to work in the

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.519
favor of the doves rather than the Hawks

6
00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.039
well it's interesting in that context

7
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.960
because you're actually seeing economic

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.939
surprises surge higher which means that

9
00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.160
data is coming in better than expected

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.019
and I think Jeffrey's comments about

11
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.599
data being weak are signs of weakness a

12
00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.460
lot of that is either market-based data

13
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.740
or Soft Data if you look at the Hard

14
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.600
data things like instead of looking at

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.399
pmis looking at industrial production

16
00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.620
they remain resilient so you haven't

17
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.840
seen enough weakness in the data to

18
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.760
really suggest that the FED needs to

19
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.739
make an about face Bob the other point

20
00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.000
that you know the Bulls have had to

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.680
contend with as we've wrestled with this

22
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.300
idea who's really in charge of this

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.700
market now have the Bulls gotten it back

24
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.559
you know Jeff makes the case now

25
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.600
obviously he's he's the bond King he's a

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.879
bond guy yeah he's going to make the

27
00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.160
case in some respects for bonds as he

28
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.920
did but it is a hurdle to get over that

29
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.239
there is

30
00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.360
there are other attractive Securities to

31
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.700
be investing in besides equities still

32
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.820
whether it's cash or fixed income I

33
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.680
think the real question and the issue

34
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.060
for the market if you want to try to get

35
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.380
the market higher if that's what your

36
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.600
goal is is all those people who are

37
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.460
buying four and a half percent one-year

38
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.920
treasuries in the middle of March that

39
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.659
were flooding the market and pulling

40
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.640
money away from the stock market we are

41
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.340
up 500 points on the S P since the

42
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.600
middle of March and everybody started

43
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.780
doing that 500 points that's 13 are

44
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.979
those people who are sitting there

45
00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.140
saying I've got four percent one year CD

46
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.119
and we're up 13 since I pulled all that

47
00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.680
money out are they going to be dragged

48
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.780
into the market right now unless they

49
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.280
think it's too late that they they

50
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.659
missed it so they're going to stay safe

51
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.180
the fomo Never Dies even at the top fomo

52
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.619
Never Dies now so let me just go one

53
00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.140
point about pal what's really motivating

54
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.820
Powell for being so aggressive the group

55
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.560
to being so aggressive and he hinted at

56
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.360
what they were really afraid about he

57
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.579
says forecasters including the FED

58
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.920
forecasters have consistently thought

59
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.380
inflation was turning down and have been

60
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.899
wrong he says we have been wrong it's

61
00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.220
better to over tighten and lose

62
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.619
credibility that seems to be what his

63
00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.760
message is today and I think that's

64
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.319
what's motivated look he said Cameron

65
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.360
the risks to inflation are still to the

66
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.580
upside I think it's pretty obvious too

67
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.440
at this point that what they thought was

68
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.660
going to be restrictive wasn't

69
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.120
restrictive enough if you look at the

70
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.040
fact that the labor market I get the

71
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.780
idea that it's it's a lagging indicator

72
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.840
it's still hung in there pretty well

73
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.720
stock market's up 20 percent since the

74
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.700
lows well they seem not to believe their

75
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.980
own forecast they talked about how PC

76
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.440
would go down to 3.9 percent he goes

77
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.819
that's a pretty aggressive forecast

78
00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.280
given where we stand today and I think

79
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.660
the thing that's interesting is that

80
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.280
we're at the same real interest rate

81
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.819
that we were prior to the Sev issues and

82
00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.760
yet valuations for tech stocks are up 30

83
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.160
percent which just means that this rally

84
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.319
has had nothing to do with the fed the

85
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.180
fed's not been the key Source or driver

86
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.640
of The Upside it's all been positioning

87
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.700
fomo AI optimism gunlock says no more

88
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.720
hikes

89
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.959
what does Dawson say I think it's still

90
00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.000
very potential that we could see more

91
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.580
hype I think that the FED still has a

92
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.440
credibility problem it's why we thought

93
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.700
that they would get to five and a

94
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.260
quarter that they wanted to make sure

95
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.819
that they delivered on what they said

96
00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.220
they were going to do so I think that if

97
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.500
data continues to be resilient the big

98
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.540
question I have is that if we have a

99
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.879
strong jobs data but softer inflation

100
00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.580
just because of those those tough comps

101
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.620
year over year what does the FED do in

102
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.959
July with that com that that combination

103
00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.819
I mean are they they're going to go

104
00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.980
overboard Bob trying to save their own

105
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.620
credibility as Cameron kind of suggests

106
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.900
yes that's what he seemed to implying

107
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.360
credibility is is more important at this

108
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.000
point doing what's right yes and

109
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.519
remember the try is square this circle

110
00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.860
the Cameron they raised their estimates

111
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.200
for GDP they lower their estimates for

112
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.360
unemployment and they act like something

113
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.819
imminent dangerous is coming they want

114
00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.379
to slow down the economy drought and

115
00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.720
raise 50 basis points it seems a little

116
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.879
it which is to your point though that

117
00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.860
the market probably doesn't believe it

118
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.540
which is why the s p

119
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.939
with positive momentarily and is only

120
00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.040
down not even you know three and a half

121
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.079
points yeah because the market still

122
00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.079
doesn't believe what Powell says or or

123
00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.880
they can withstand the 50 basis points

124
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.979
if it does actually happen I I happen to

125
00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.479
think Jeff is right I think they're not

126
00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.100
going to do it yeah I think they just

127
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.139
need to keep that credibility and if

128
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.300
they over tighten so be it better than

129
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.639
lose credibility how said we've been

130
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.040
wrong on our inflation forecast they

131
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.540
can't have that happen well their

132
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.080
credibility is
